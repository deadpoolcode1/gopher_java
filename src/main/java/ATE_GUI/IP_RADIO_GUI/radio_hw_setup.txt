1. Connect NICs and Install Drivers:

    Ensure both Ethernet NICs are physically connected to the appropriate network cables.
    Make sure you have the latest drivers installed for both NICs.
    Assign Static IP Addresses:
        Right-click on the Start menu and select "Network Connections."
        Right-click on the first Ethernet connection (NIC 1) and select "Properties."
        Select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" and click "Properties."
        Choose the option to "Use the following IP address" and enter 192.20.1.100 as the IP address, and 255.255.0.0 as the subnet mask.

    Follow the same steps for the second Ethernet connection (NIC 2), assigning 192.20.2.100 as the IP address and the same subnet mask.

2. Configure Routing for NIC 1:

    Open a Command Prompt as administrator.
    Run the command to add a static route for the device you want to communicate with through NIC 1:
        "route -p add 172.20.99.192 mask 255.255.255.255 172.20.1.100"
    This command sets up a static route for the specific device 172.20.99.192 through NIC 1's IP address.

3. Configure Routing for NIC 2:

    Similarly, run the following command to add a static route for the device you want to communicate with through NIC 2:
        route -p add 172.20.77.161 mask 255.255.255.255 172.20.2.100

4 Validate Routing Table:

    Run the command route print in the Command Prompt to verify that the static routes have been added correctly and are active.
5. Disable Automatic Metric:

    As mentioned earlier, you may want to manually set the metric values for each NIC to prioritize their usage.
    Follow the steps described in the previous response to set the metric values for both NICs.
6. Testing:

    Connect the devices you want to communicate with to the respective NICs.
    Test connectivity by sending both TCP and UDP traffic to the designated devices' IP addresses.
    The routing configuration should ensure that the traffic goes through the correct NIC based on the static routes you've set up.
    Remember that these configurations can affect your network setup, and it's advisable to make these changes when you're familiar
     with networking concepts. Additionally, setting up static routes might lead to network issues if not done correctly,
     so be cautious and have a backup plan in case anything goes wrong.

 7. If you encounter issues or need to undo the configurations you've made for the multiple NICs and static routes,
     you can follow these steps to revert to your previous network configuration:

    Removing Static Routes:

    Open a Command Prompt as administrator.
        Run the command to delete the static routes you previously added. For example, to remove the route for 192.20.11.22 through NIC 1:
            route delete 172.20.99.192
        Repeat the command for any other static routes you added.
